# My Dev Setup 2025

So, I recently got a new laptop and revamped my development setup. I thought it would be a good idea to share my setup and the tools I use on a daily basis.

The desk/cabinet is a bit old and you can see some wear and tear but it gets the job done till I upgrade. I have a pretty minimal setup with just the essentials. I like to keep my workspace clean and clutter-free.

Here's a quick overview of my setup:

- **Hardware**:
  - **Laptop:** [MacBook Pro M4 Pro 16-inch](https://www.apple.com/in/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch-space-black-standard-display-apple-m4-pro-with-14-core-cpu-and-20-core-gpu-24gb-memory-512gb)
  - **Monitor:** HP E233 23-inch (got this from my office, not the best but works fine for now)
  - **Keyboard:** [Royal Kludge RK68](https://meckeys.com/shop/keyboard/65-keyboard/rk68-rgb-gateron-mechanical-switches/)
  - **Mouse:** [Logitech G402](https://www.logitechg.com/en-nz/products/gaming-mice/g402-hyperion-fury-fps-gaming-mouse.html)

  - **Docking Station:** Honeywell USB-C Docking Station (got this from my office as well)
  - **Laptop Stand:** [Zebronics Laptop Stand](https://shop.zebronics.com/products/zeb-ns2000) (not the best but does the job)

I have also recently gotten into homelabbing. It is pretty fun and I am learning a lot. I had a small server running at home on my Raspberry Pi 4 but the SD card got corrupted so I had to take it down ( 😔 ). I am planning to get it back up again and build a new server as well with an old laptop if I happen to get one. I will be documenting the whole process in a separate blog post.

I had the following running on my pi:

- [Docker Compose](https://docker.com): Container Orchestration
- [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/): Media Server
- [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/): Network-wide Ad Blocker
- [Portainer](https://portAINER.io/): Docker Container Management
- [Uptime Kuma](https://uptimekuma.com/): Self-hosted Monitoring Tool
- [CasaOS](https://casaos.org/): Home Server Management
- The ARRs:
  - [Radarr](https://radarr.video/): Movies
  - [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/): TV Shows
  - [Prowlarr](https://prowlarr.com/): Indexers
- [FlareSolverr](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr): Bypass Cloudflare
- [ByteStash](https://github.com/jordan-dalby/ByteStash): Snippet Manager
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/): VPN

Going forward, I will be storing all my dotfiles in a Github repo so that I can easily set up my environment on any new machine.
