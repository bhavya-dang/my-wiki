# Building my first React Native app

I have been wanting to build a React Native app for a long time now. I used to watch a lot of tutorials on Youtube and save them in my `Watch Later` playlist but I never got around to building anything.

Two weeks ago, I said fuck it and finally started the project. It was a bit of a struggle at first, but I eventually got the hang of it due to my experience with React. I built a simple habit tracker that lets you track your habits daily and see your progress over time.

## The Code

The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bhavya-dang/habit-tracker-rn).

## The App

It lets you add habits, check them off when you complete them and see your progress over time in the form of streaks and habit scores.

You can also edit or delete habits and reset your progress if you want to start over. Moreover, the app supports dark mode and lets you set daily habit goals and sends you notifications to remind you to complete your habits.
