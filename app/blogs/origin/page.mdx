I have tried creating a blog so many times in the past, but I always ended up abandoning it. I'm not sure why, but I think it's because I always felt like I had to write about something profound or groundbreaking. But I've come to realize that it's okay to write about whatever I want, even if it's just a random collection of thoughts and ideas.

I have always had one excuse after the another. I have to work on this project, or that assignment, or I have that exam coming so I have to prioritise that.

Now I have finally decided to take some time out of my day and write about anything. It doesn't have to be anything knowledgeable or profound. It just has to be honest.
